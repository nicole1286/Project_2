World Happiness Rank

Project 2 proposal

Happiness group

Topic: Happiness scores around the world.

Dataset: Wikipedia table and kaggle dataset. 

Our dataset consists of 158 countries records which will be loaded to SQL. We are planning to use leaflet to make a map that shows the different countries and their happiness scores/life expectancy/ obesity index/ economic freedom. This map will be user interactive via layer groups and layer controls.
