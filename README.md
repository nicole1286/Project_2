World Happiness Rank

Dataset: Wikipedia table and kaggle dataset. 

Our dataset consists of 158 countries records which will be read into pandas dataframes that get cleaned and merged then finally loaded to Sqlite.  Query database to plot graphs based on certain factors for comparison. We are planning to use leaflet to make a map that shows the different countries and their happiness scores/life expectancy/ obesity index/ economic freedom. This map will be user interactive via layer groups and layer controls.  Deploy the analysis to a webpage for visualization.
